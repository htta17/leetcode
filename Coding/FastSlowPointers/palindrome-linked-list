Need to utilize linked list reversal to solve this problem.

Reverse a linked list using two pointers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0_I-ZF0S38&ab_channel=NeetCode

```py

from linked_list import LinkedList
from linked_list_reverse import reverse_linked_list
from print_list import print_list_with_forward_arrow


def palindrome(head):
    
    fast = head
    slow = head

    #when we reach the end of this list, slow will be the middle
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next

    prev = None

    while slow:
        tmp = slow.next
        slow.next = prev
        prev = slow
        slow = tmp

    left, right = head, prev
    while right:
        if left.data != right.data:
            return False
        left = left.next
        right = right.next
    return True



```
